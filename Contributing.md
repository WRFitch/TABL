- Master branch contains main development build
- Release branch off master branch contains the “final” build
- Testing branch off master branch is used for integrated tests & user tests
- When developing a feature, branch off of master and implement in that branch. 
  - Create testing sub-branch for each feature.
  - Name each branch the name of the activity/function/requirement you are implementing
