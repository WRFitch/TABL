**Iman**: Horizontal recyclerview, Dietary filter dialog

**Edrin**: fix image bug, refine frontend 

**Adit**: adjust/remove item dialog, Add tip dialog

**Monika**: Test database design, Parcelable data flow, 

**Simran**: Business plan, Test database design, Parcelable data flow


IF WE CAN'T DO THE HORIZONTAL RECYCLERVIEW:

Edrin: Submenu page design

Iman: Submenu Implementation


#### PRIORITIES: COMPLETE JAVA FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING DATA FLOW

- Implement server:
  - hosting 
  - database 
  - application 
- Implement Android data flow:
  - rework data into parcelable classes
  - define exactly how data is recieved from the server, and how it is processed
- Rework frontend to match design exactly
- Dialog boxes (4 total):
  - Dietary filter Dialog (on Menu Activity)
  - Adjust item Dialog (on Menu Activity)
  - Adjust/remove item Dialog (on Basket Activity)
  - Add tip Dialog (on Basket Activity)
- implement android HTTP library 
  - Volley or RetroFit?
    - find out if caching is included in either of these
  - if no caching in volley or retrofit, a library for this will be needed. 

#### How the Database works:
- Will be hosted on 'Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform' (has most of the commands for setting up stack)
- Runs on Linux/Ubuntu machine server (virtual computer that holds database & database application) 
- 'Java Spring' framework using REST API
  - 'REST API' uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

#### STRETCH GOALS:
- fix image bug (but properly)
- Implement Nightmode
