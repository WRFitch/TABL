# Sprint 4

Start: 4th March 

End: 24th March

#### PRIORITIES: COMPLETE JAVA FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING DATA FLOW

- Implement server
  - hosting
  - database 
  - application
- Implement Android data flow
  - rework data into parcelable classes
  - define exactly how data is recieved from the server, and how it is processed
- Rework frontend to match design exactly

#### How the Database works:
- Will run on Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform (has most of the commands for setting up stack)
- Ubuntu machine server (virtual computer that holds database & database application) 
- Java spring framework using REST API
  - REST API uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.

#### STRETCH GOALS:
- fix image bug (but properly)
- Implement Nightmode
