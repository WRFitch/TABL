#### PRIORITIES: COMPLETE JAVA FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDING DATA FLOW

#### How the Database works:

- Runs on Linux/Ubuntu machine server (virtual computer that holds database & database application) 
- 'Java Spring' framework using REST API
  - 'REST API' uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.
