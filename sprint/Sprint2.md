# Sprint 2

Start: 21st Jan 

End: 10th Feb

Focus is on implementing prototypes of certain functions in XML and Java, as well as deciding on a backend solution to be implemented starting in Sprint 4. 

By the end of this sprint, ideally we would have XML wireframes implemented in Android Studio, with limited functionality implemented in java. We would also have gathered information regarding exactly how to implement a backend solution using LAMP-style architecture on Azure, AWS or Brunel's servers, replacing the PHP component of LAMP with Java Spring. Technically, it's LAMS.

#### PRIORITIES: XML WIREFRAMES FOR AGREED ACTIVITIES

---

## Sprint Goals
Complete prototypes of Table Selection [SIMRAN], Menu [IMAN], Basket [ADIT]
  - Implement custom views for Menu [WILL] and Basket [MONIKA]
- Implement some basic functionality for Table Selection, Menu, Map, Basket
- Fix prototype of Map screen [WILL]
  - Find API key solution - API key is imported 
- Define a good backend solution
  - FireBase
    - Free
    - Auto setup
    - NoSQL - interesting rules on how to expand, very little legacy code to work with.
  - LAMP-style stack
    - Resource-intensive to set up
    - enormous amounts of resources and permutations
    - would learn far more useful skills - Linux sysadmin, Apache, Docker, MySQL, Python/Spring
- Source temporary placeholder assets for the app & verify if they should be imported into the repository or stored elsewhere - if so, we can build a separate store of information including Google Maps API key. [EDRIN] (you only have to do the first two bits, don't have to make the separate storage)
