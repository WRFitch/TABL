A group project between six 2nd-year computer science students at Brunel University, this project took place over 6 months starting at a very limited knowledge of android development and no knowledge of any backend stack, and culminating with an (almost) completed application. This repo is presented unmodified to record this learning process. I'd write a proper retrospective but 58 pages of a uni assignment is more than enough.
