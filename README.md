## ORDR - an app to allow users to order food on their phones, without needing an app for each restaurant. ##

For each item on the TODO, open a separate branch, implement the function, then merge when you're done. This should prevent any major merge conflicts and keep us delivering a testable app. 

#### TODO ####
* rename project 
* design visual assets & update 
* design restaurant finder function & implement  
* finalise user flow & write into design doc
* write automated tests for software functions
* test on users
