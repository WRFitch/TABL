## TABL - an app to allow users to order food on their phones, without needing an app for each restaurant. 

For each item on the TODO list, open a separate branch, implement the function, then merge when you're done. This should prevent any major merge conflicts and keep us delivering a testable app. The main branch of this repository should be the most polished version, any work in progress should be confined to its own branch until it is implemented and tested. See Contributing.md for details.
